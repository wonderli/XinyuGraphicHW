How to compile this program:
run:
	make
How to run this program:
	./rt <input.iv> <output.ppm> <yres> <xres> <shadow_on> <reflection_on> <refraction_on> <depth_of_field_on>
        for example:
		My Scene file is li.iv, so I run this raytracer by using the following command:
		./rt li.iv li.ppm 800 800 1 1 1 0 (I close the depth of field, because it is cost too much time...)
I've implemented solid texture which is checkerboard, wood grain.
I've add a new cylinder object to the program, there two cylinder with golden color and several red spheres on there.
In my li.iv scene, I put two cylinder, one cube and 7 spheres on it.
